Coding some basic rpg systems in C++ for practice and fun.

## Design Ideas

Some quick theoretical lists that we will iterate on.

### Character Classes

- Warrior: Highest HP
- Wizard: Highest Magic Defense
- Cleric: Best Support Abilities
- Rogue: Highest Physical Damage

### Leveling System

- Gain stats and abilities based on class and levels.

#### Stats

- Strength: Involved in Physical Calculations
- Intelligence: Involved in Magic Calculations
- Agility: Involved in Nimbleness Calculations
- Armor: Involved in Physical Reduction Calculations
- Resistance: Involved in Element Damage Reduction Calculations

#### Levels

- Level Trees

### Items

- Shop System
- Equipment
- Consumables

### Game Loop

- Battle System: Turn Based
- World Levels
- Different Monsters
